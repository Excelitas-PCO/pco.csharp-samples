# pco.csharp-samples
Project for wrapping whole pco.sdk into C# and applying the high level SDK structure on top of it. 
This project contains different C# samples showing how to use Excelitas PCO's pco.csharp package,   
which can be downloaded from our homepage: [pco.csharp](https://www.excelitas.com/product/pco-software-development-kits#custom-tab-c_)  
The samples look for the C# package in the default installation folder.
